# Computer-generated holograms compression algorithm

This project is a part of Bachelor’s thesis: “Design of the algorithm of a lossless compression of computer-generated holograms”. This document describes basic usage of 4 python files created for the purposes of this project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Below you can find suggested requirements for using the scripts. Even though it is probably possible to use different versions of libraries, programs were not tested for other configurations.

- Python 3.5
- OpenCV 3.1 for Python
- NumPy 

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/puszolek/holo_compression
```
In samples folder you can find some sample hologram to test the algorithms.
